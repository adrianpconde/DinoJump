# Dino Jump!

<i>It's time to kick some a*s in the last days of the Cretaceous period! </i>

The video game is platform style, with slight elements of the action genre. This little online game is part of the first project developed by me within the Part Time Web Development Bootcamp by Ironhack. 


## Description

Blue is the last dinosaur of its kind, a special specimen, the only one capable of jumping and breaking through the threats of Redex and his terrible helpers, Velociraptors and T-Rex warning of evil. Help Blue end the tyranny of Redex, a rather tough red Maiasaura giant. 

Accumulate points by beating the speedy helpers of Redex. When you exceed 80 points you will be able to meet the final enemy, a more complicated giant dinosaur. Make sure you don't waste a second to shoot him!

In addition, the end of the Cretaceous era is approaching and meteorites do not stop falling. Do not let them hit you and lose the game before finishing off the evil Redex.
