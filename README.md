# Dino Jump!

<i>It's time to kick some a*s in the last days of the Cretaceous period! </i>


Blue is the last dinosaur of its kind, a special specimen, the only one capable of jumping and breaking through the threats of Redex and his terrible helpers, Velociraptors and T-Rex warning of evil. Help Blue end the tyranny of Redex, a rather tough red Maiasaura giant.

The video game is platform style, with slight elements of the action genre. This little online game is part of the first project developed by me within the Part Time Web Development Bootcamp by Ironhack.
